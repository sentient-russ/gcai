    </p>

    <p>All user profile information is provided on a voluntary basis.  There are no input fields for our user's real names for a reason.

There are some voluntary fields under the user profile section that GroupConscience.io may use to improve our services. These imputs may be used for future features that allow the AI to give results based on sobriety length, etc. We ask that if you decide to use them that you keep them current and honest.</p>
